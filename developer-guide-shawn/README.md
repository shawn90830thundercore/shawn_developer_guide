# ðŸ¥‚ Welcome!

Welcome to the most exciting and state-of-the-art platform to build your blockchain application on ThunderCore Blockchain. If you are an Ethereum developer, developing on ThunderCore should be seamless and smooth as ThunderCore is fully Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible and inherits most of the tools and libraries from Ethereum.

This page acts as a quick guide into the ThunderCore developer platform. You will find links to some useful resources and websites to set you off on the journey of building applications on ThunderCore. Feel free to reach out to us on Telegram/Discord when you need any help!

### Developer quick start

Since ThunderCore is a fork of Ethereum, our blockchain natively supports EVM compatible smart contracts. The following briefly lists the tools required to develop on ThunderCore.

* Setup Metamask Wallet or other web wallet
* Deploy your contracts on ThunderCore
  * [Using Remix](deploying-on-thundercore/using-remix.md)
  * [Using Truffle](deploying-on-thundercore/using-truffle.md)
  * [Using Hardhat](deploying-on-thundercore/using-hardhat-include-create-a-project-steps.md)
* Testnet faucet: [https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com/](https://faucet-testnet.thundercore.com)
* Blockchain Explorers
  * Mainnet: [https://viewblock.io/thundercore](https://viewblock.io/thundercore)
  * Testnet: [https://scan-testnet.thundercore.com/](https://scan-testnet.thundercore.com)
* The ThunderCore's external protocol is compatible with Ethereum. Your existing code supporting Ethereum has a good chance to work as-is

#### How do I get a ThunderCore address? <a href="how-do-i-get-a-thundercore-address" id="how-do-i-get-a-thundercore-address"></a>

ThunderCore is Ethereum (EVM) compatible. Any address created for Ethereum will work on ThunderCore. One can use MetaMask and/or any other popular Ethereum wallet to create ThunderCore address. To access the ThunderCore blockchain all one has to do is to point network RPC to one of the following:

| RPC | Reference                                                                    |
